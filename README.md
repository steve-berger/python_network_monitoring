# Python network connectivity monitoring tool

This project is a simple python script which periodically pings an IP (8.8.8.8 in this case).

## Why?

The use for this is my internet connectivity disrupts from time to time since upgrading my internet and getting a new router from my ISP.
And I simply forget writing the times down for contacting my ISP and have something in hand to give them.
